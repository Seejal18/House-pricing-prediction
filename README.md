# House-pricing prediction----The House Pricing Prediction project leverages machine learning to estimate the selling price of residential properties based on various features. The primary goal is to build a predictive model using historical housing data, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering data on property attributes (e.g., location, size, number of rooms, amenities) and cleaning it to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and selecting influential features, such as neighborhood quality, proximity to facilities, and market trends, to improve model accuracy.
Model Selection: Experimenting with machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Fine-tuning the model through hyperparameter optimization.
Deployment: Developing a user-friendly interface to input property details and output predicted prices, making the model accessible to end-users.
The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in analyzing complex datasets, providing accurate predictions, and contributing to a more transparent real estate market.
